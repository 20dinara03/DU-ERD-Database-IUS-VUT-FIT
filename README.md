# DU ERD – Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Administrative Data System

This project presents an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for a database system related to administrative decisions and governmental structures. The model describes relationships between **officials, institutions, administrative decisions, and territorial divisions**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Designed using:** ERD methodology
- **Database Concept:** Administrative and governmental data management
- **Key Entities & Relationships:**
  - **Official (Úředník)** – Identified by a unique personal number
  - **Administrative Decision (Úřední rozhodnutí)** – Stores decisions, dates, and reasoning
  - **Government Institution (Úřad)** – Includes offices, their locations, and operational periods
  - **Territorial Division (Územní členění)** – Describes hierarchical geographic regions
  - **Education (Studium)** – Tracks education details of officials
  - **Official Position (Funkce úředníka & Funkce úřadu)** – Represents roles and terms in office

## 🏗️ ERD Model Overview
The **ERD diagram** illustrates how different entities interact, with primary keys (`PK`) ensuring **data integrity**. Key relationships:
- Officials **issue decisions**
- Institutions **manage officials and decisions**
- Territorial divisions **define jurisdiction**
- Education records **track academic history**
- Official functions **document job roles over time**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Analyze the ERD model** (`DU_ERD_Garipova.pdf`) to understand the database structure.
2. **Use the relationships** to develop a database schema.
3. **Extend or modify** the model for specific governmental or administrative use cases.
